This is also the reason why sprites of Rhydon were so widespread in the original games. In that same interview, Sugimori mentions Lapras and Clefairy as some of the other earliest Pokémon designs to join Rhydon. You cand read more about it here!",

As a boy, he would spend hours finding and collecting bugs and insects.In fact he spent so much time doing it, his friends called him \'Dr. Bug\', and he originally wanted to become a bug scientist - or entomologist, to give it its proper name.We\'re glad he decided to work in video games instead!"

In fact, it's basically impossible to 'Catch 'Em All' since some Pokémon don't actually appear in the game, especially some of the rarer or older ones.It's fun trying to find them though! Ivysaur is the only second - stage grass - poison evolution that does not require an item to reach its final formOther Grass - Poison types in the Kanto region require a special stone to achieve its final or alternate forms. An example of this is getting Gloom to evolve into Bellossom."
