    <p>Pokemon Go has captured the world's heart, and maybe even made America great again. In fact, not even a global
        pandemic significantly slowed Pokemon Go's momentum. With some precautions, we can catch them all, and stay
        healthy at the same time.
        <br><br>
        Pokemon Go has received several updates since its launch, making it incredibly fun to play. It requires you to
        get up, leave the couch, and visit real-world locations to replenish important items, participate in Gym and
        Raid Battles, and of course, catch wild Pokemon. The rules have been relaxed during the COVID-19 era (you can
        play indoors!), but going outside is still generally the point.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, the game provides little guidance on the nuances of catching, collecting, and evolving
        Pokemon—there's barely a tutorial. If you're just starting out, see How to Get Started and Catch 'Em All for a
        primer on what every icon means, how to capture Pokemon, and other basics.
        <br><br>
        The following advanced tips and tricks go one step further to help you truly master Pokemon Go, use it to
        enhance your other Pokemon adventures on consoles, and maybe, just maybe, put you in the mood for the upcoming
        Pokemon Sleep.

    <h2>Get swole with Mega Evolutions</h2>

        Pokemon Go has new mechanics that add depth to the gameplay. With Mega Evolutions, select Pokemon (like
        Charizard and Gengar) can become more powerful versions of themselves for a limited amount of time.
        <br>
        To activate this feature, you'll need to accrue Mega Energy for the Pokemon you wish to evolve. The best way to
        score Mega Energy is by beating Mega Raids as fast as you can.

    <h2> Study the evolution path</h2>

        The Pokédex shows you how Pokémon evolve and it's worth knowing the evolutionpath of a POkemon that you're
        interested in. For example, if you have lots of Pichu and few Pikachu, you probably don't want to spend Candy
        evolving Pichu into more Pikachu but rather save them until you can evolve Pikachu into Raichu, which needs more
        Candy and ir rare and much stronger.
        <br>
        Simply put, making more mid-tier Pokémon is less useful than getting the rare ones who are more likely to win in
        battles.
        <br>
        Also, as the game expands, manu Pokémon now have another form to evolve into. For instance, with the addition of
        the Sinnoh region, you can use a Sinnoh Stone to evolve cartain Pokémon, meaning some Pokémon you thought were
        finished can now do something else.

    <p>
        The buddy system in Pokémon GO is extremely beneficial for a variety of reasons. Selecting a buddy Pokémon
        allows players to walk with them in order to earn candy. Some Pokémon are easier to earn candy with than others
        due to the kilometer requirement. The kilometer per candy can range from one kilometer to 20 kilometers per
        candy earned. Players can also do activities such as giving their Pokémon a treat or battling with them in order
        to raise their buddy hearts, which can grant a variety of bonuses. In some cases, this is necessary to evolve
        certain Pokémon.
        <br>
        Some Pokémon don't appear often and making them your buddy can earn you those types Candy Slowly as you walk.
        With time, you'll find you have enough to evolve that Pokémon. Wich lead us to the next tip!

    <h3>How to find rare Pokémon</h3>

        Because of the way Pokémon Go is created, there is no way to guarantee that you will actually discover a rare
        Pokémon that you don’t already have. However, there are some things you can do to help yourself find new
        Pokémon. Here are some tips to help you find and capture rare Pokémon.
        What's the best way to find rare Pokémon?
        <br>
        The best way to find rare Pokémon is to continue exploring places where rare Pokémon have been seen before. Use
        the radar available on the right side of your screen to see if there are any unrecognized creatures nearby.
        Those unrecognized creatures will show as an outline, meaning they have not yet been categorized in your
        Pokédex.
    <h3>Lure Modules and Incense<h3>
            <br>
            Lure Modules and Incense can boost the number of Pokémon you encounter at parks and PokéStops.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Gym Battles and Raids</h3>
            <br>
            Gym fights and Raids are great places to get Pokémon you don't already have because higher-level Trainers
            will
            attract higher-level Pokémon.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Pokémon Trainer Level</h3>
            <br>
            Also, the amount of rare Pokémon you encounter is based on your Trainer level, so level up to find better
            Pokémon.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Pokémon Nests</h3>
            <br>
            There are some places that frequently contain rare Pokémon, called nests. The locations of these nests are
            being
            shared on web pages, but there is not currently one master list of these nests and their locations.

    <h2>How to master Gyms</h2>

    <p>
        Having existed since the game’s launch back in the summer of 2016 and updated several times since then, gyms are
        an integral part of the Pokémon GO experience. Team Mystic, Valor, and Instinct all fight for control over the
        gyms so that their color can adorn each arena. Winning gym battles will net players valuable experience to help
        them level up, so here are some tips to improve arena performance.

    <h3>Master Type Matchups</h3>
    <br>
    Trainers can bring six of their Pokémon with them when they choose to take on a gym, similarly to the max amount
    of party members players can have in the mainline games. Before a battle, consider which allies have the best
    type matchups against the opponents defending the gym. If they all have the same type, choosing a team that
    counters it will be easy. However, a well-defended team will have strong type diversity to stave off attacks
    from other teams, so selecting a lineup of Pokémon that fare well against the opponent is crucial. As there can
    only be 6 defenders at a time, try to find a Pokémon to counter each one individually. Pay close attention to
    what attacks the Pokémon has, as it won’t always match their type.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Know the Order of Appearances</h3>
    <br>
    While it may appear as if players fight the enemy Pokémon randomly, there is a designated order. Pokémon in gym
    battles will appear in the order they were placed in, so the first Pokémon will be the first one fought, and the
    last one battled will be the one placed there most recently. Knowing this order can help players plan their team
    by picking their Pokémon in an order that counters the opposing team. To check when the defending Pokémon were
    placed, tap on the gym to see each Pokémon, then tap each one to see how long ago it was placed.

    <h3>Conserve Charged Attacks</h3>
    <br>
    After attacking the opponent for a long period of time, the player’s Pokémon will build up energy for their
    charge attack. It may be tempting to let it loose the moment it’s charged up, but consider saving it for later.
    Some enemy Pokémon stationed in the gym will have lower combat power than others, meaning they’ll be easier to
    take down. Using a charged move on a weaker opponent isn’t necessary when they can be easily beaten with quick
    attacks, so preserve charged attacks for when the stronger enemy Pokémon come onto the field.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Know When to Switch</h3>
    <br>
    Players are given the option to switch out their Pokémon after defeating an opponent, or whenever they feel the
    need to. While it’s always in the trainer’s best interest to have as favorable of a type matchup as possible,
    there is an exception. Pokémon will conserve energy, so their charged attacks won’t go away when a new defending
    Pokémon is sent onto the field. Before switching out into a more optimal ally, unleash any remaining charged
    attacks so the energy doesn’t go to waste.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Battle with Friends</h3>
    <br>
    Trainers don’t need to attack a gym alone. If they have any friends nearby, then they’ll be able to battle the
    gym together! When doing so, the Pokémon defending the gym will take hits from all players currently fighting.
    However, keep in mind that a trainer won’t be able to join a fight if their team is defending the gym.
